# Big Data Taxi Analysis 🚖
This project shows how I applied big data tools to analyze taxi trip information using Hadoop MapReduce.

## 📂 What it does

  - Trip insights: Finds short, medium, and long trips for each taxi, and calculates fares.
  - Clustering: Groups trips by drop-off location to identify travel patterns.
  - Company comparison: Counts trips for each taxi company and ranks them.
  - 
## ⚙️ How it runs

  - Written in Python.
  - Runs on AWS EMR (cloud-based Hadoop).
  - Uses shell scripts to launch each task.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

  - Python
  - Hadoop Streaming
  - AWS EMR (cloud execution)

## ✨ Why this matters
This project demonstrates the ability to:
  - Work with large datasets.
  - Use cloud and big data technologies.
  - Produce business insights from raw data.

  📌 This project was part of my coursework and also serves as a portfolio piece to showcase big data engineering skills.
